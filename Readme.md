This repository hosts the project to build for the exam of the course Database - Module A, from the Data Analysis degree of the University of Messina.
The project consists in the creation of a web application that is capable of managing a database through html forms and PHP.
My project aims at managing a comic book collection. 

The conceptual schema is presented through an Entity-Relationship model drawn with the application draw.io, that can be downloaded from the github repository: https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop

The logical schema is implemented through sql code within the file create_database.sql. The file contains the code for the creation of the database and of the relations (tables) that describe its schema.

The webapp is built through simple html files that code forms that allow to submit the data to PHP variables that are fed to a MySQL server through PHP files.
